Then, they choose their oppenent. The main strategy to the game is choosing the right opponent (hint, one is not like the other). After each attack, your oppenent will attack you and both your's and your opponent's health points will go down according to attack points. Then afterwards, your character's attack will increase. After you have defeated all of the opponents, you'll earn a win screen. Otherwise, you lose.
